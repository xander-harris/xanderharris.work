I'm Xander Harris, a software product manager in Portland, Oregon. I like understanding how things work: the forces, decisions, and inertia that shape systems, whether technical, political, or social. This is where I document what I'm exploring, tinkering with, and occasionally trying to fix.

## Active Work

I develop and maintain tax calculation tools for [Oregon VITA volunteers](https://ortaxvolunteers.org), helping preparers navigate Oregon-specific deductions and credits. These tools support free tax preparation services for families earning under $67,000. **(Volunteer)**
